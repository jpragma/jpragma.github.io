JPragma is a private company, specializing in software development and consulting services.

### Custom Software Development

We take pride in our craftsmanship and create design and code, which is efficient, robust, and clean. Both "Fixed price" and "Time-and-Materials" pricing models are available. We recommend a "fixed-price" model for projects that have clear requirements and limited scope and "T&M" contracts for long-term projects with dynamic requirements.

### Independent architecture and code reviews

Perhaps you already have your internal development team or work with another consulting company. We can regularly review processes, architecture, and code artifacts, creating a detailed report that outlines what can be improved and where.

### Bootstrap development process

We specialize in setting up highly efficient software development processes and infrastructure. This infrastructure includes CI/CD pipelines, quality gates, testing automation, and reporting.
