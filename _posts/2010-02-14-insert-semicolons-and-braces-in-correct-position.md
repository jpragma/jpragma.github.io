One thing that always disturbed me when editing Java source files is that you need to move your hands out of keyboard's home row, press &lt;End&gt; and then type semicolon or open brace. Not anymore! I recently discovered pretty cool feature in Eclipse that automatically inserts semicolons and braces in correct positions.

Enable this option via Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Typing dialog.
